- Frontend Developer • React & TypeScript

- 💬 About Me

- Hi! I'm José Gabriel Hernández, a frontend developer passionate about transforming ideas into digital experiences. I specialize in React and TypeScript, with a focus on creating clean, scalable, and user-centric interfaces.

- I'm motivated by constantly learning new technologies, sharing knowledge, and working on projects that challenge my skills. I firmly believe that good design and solid implementation can make all the difference.

Version Control: Git, GitHub

Best Practices: Componentization, basic testing, accessibility, performance

## Featured Projects
Here are some representative examples of my work (you can see more in my portfolio):
[ntro Component with Sign Up Form] — This project was a form to validate form inputs. If the fields are empty, you'll get an error (Validate form inputs with a Zoe library). These are the technologies used in the project (React, Typescript, Talwind CCS).

[Ping single column coming soon page] — This time form was a very basic one with just One input. I know we actually don't have to send data to a server, so it was more focused on simple validation. In the future, I definitely want to work with much more complicated ways of sending data and validate forms in a more secure way. (React, Typescript, Talwind CCS).

[Real Estate] — This is a project of apartments, villas, and more with an interactive website for the sale of exclusive luxury homes and apartments.
